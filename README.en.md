APIMart is a low-cost API platform for AI image & video generation — GPT-Image-2 from $0.006/image, 160+ images per dollar. One async API covers both image and video: submit a task, get an ID, fetch results via polling or callback. Batch tens of thousands of images without timeouts, switch models without changing code.

## 📝 Development Background

Does anyone else share my long-standing grievances with PowerPoint?  😡:

💔 **No Image Titles**: Unlike Word, you can't directly add titles to images. You have to manually insert text boxes and struggle with alignment!

💔 **No Copy-Paste Element Positioning**: To keep similar elements in consistent positions across slides, you have to copy-paste and modify each time - no way to just copy-paste positions.

💔 **No Auto-Align for Images**: Insert multiple images and want them neatly arranged? Either drag each one manually for eternity or align them column by column.

💔 **No Code Block Insertion**: Have to copy-paste from external editors or screenshot code blocks - so tedious!

💔 **No LaTeX Formula Support**: Now I mainly rely on AI to recognize/generate math formulas in LaTeX format, which can't be directly pasted to PPT...

...

Most PPT plugins are packed with flashy but impractical features. As a graduate student doing weekly research progress reports, I need to quickly insert content and make clear presentations - aesthetics are secondary.

With AI's help, I developed solutions to these pain points quickly! (Over 99% of this plugin's code was AI-generated. Thank you AI teacher!)

In the spirit of open source, this plugin is publicly available on GitHub. Stars are appreciated!  🌟

##  ✨ Key Features

- **Batch Add Image Titles:** Supports batch selection of images to add centered captions below them. Allows configuring auto-grouping of images and captions.

- **Batch Add Image Labels:** For scientific figures, supports label templates (`A`, `a`, `A)`, `a)`, `1`, `1)`). Default label font is `Arial`.

- **Auto-arrange Images:** Automatically aligns multiple images with configurable:
  - Sorting: By position or selection order
  - Layout: 
    - Column-max-width (for tabular layouts in academic figures)
    - Uniform height (uses first image's height by default)
    - Uniform width (waterfall flow, uses first image's width by default)
    - Custom spacing between columns/rows

  - Block formats: 
    - Headings, lists (preserves hanging indents), code blocks (editable text boxes with syntax highlighting)
    - Tables (limited to 500px width with 1pt black borders by default)
    - Math formulas (editable text boxes)
    - Blockquotes (text boxes with black borders)
    - Task lists (converts to  ☑/☐ indicators)

* **Batch Add Image Labels**: For scientific figures, choose label templates (`A`, `a`, `A)`, `a)`). Default font is `Arial`.

## 🖥️ Installation

1. Download the plugin's `.exe` installer from GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/Achuan-2/SlideSCI/releases)
2. Double-click to install
   
Important:
- Close PowerPoint before installation, otherwise the plugin won't load immediately

Required Dependencies (usually prompted automatically during installation):
1. [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0+](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=17718)
2. [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Tools for Office Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=105522)

- If the plugin doesn't appear in PowerPoint or shows "Runtime error loading COM add-in", install the dependencies above

## ❓ FAQs

* **How to add plugin features to the Quick Access Toolbar?**  
  Right-click a button and select "Add to Quick Access Toolbar."  
  ![](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/Achuan-2/PicBed/assets/PixPin_2025-01-16_16-56-07-2025-01-16.png)  
  Move the Quick Access Toolbar below the ribbon for easier access.

* **LaTeX formulas display incorrectly?**  
  Best for single-line formulas. For complex multi-line formulas, use [IguanaTex](https://github.com/Jonathan-LeRoux/IguanaTex).
